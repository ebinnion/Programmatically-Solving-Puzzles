Programmatically-Solving-Puzzles
================================

This project is part of a multi-year UGROW research project at Midwestern State University, led by Dr. Jeffrey Hood, that will solve a puzzle using only the outer edges of the puzzle pieces.

My work on the algorithm lasted approximately 4 weeks. As of now, the algorithm will do curve matching, but with bugs. It errors after a few puzzle pieces.
