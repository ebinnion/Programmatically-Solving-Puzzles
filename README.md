#Programmatically-Solving-Puzzles

This project is part of a multi-year UGROW research project at Midwestern State University, led by Dr. Jeffrey Hood, that will solve a puzzle using only the outer edges of the puzzle pieces.

My work on the algorithm lasted approximately 4 weeks. As of now, the algorithm will do curve matching, but with bugs. It errors after a few puzzle pieces.

You can see my work starting on [line 33 of the Bez_Spline.m file](https://github.com/ebinnion/Programmatically-Solving-Puzzles/blob/master/Bez_Spline.m#L33).

#Future Work
Future work will include finding a more robust method of doing curve matching that will work on all cubics along a puzzle's edge.

Dr. Hood and I have theorized a more robust, but brute force, method of performing the curve matching that we are hopefuly for.
